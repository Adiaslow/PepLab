### PepLab

**PepLab** is a peptide library generation toolkit designed to support various workflows for processing peptide libraries, generating 3D structures, analyzing reactivity, planning reactions, and executing reactions. It provides a comprehensive platform for peptide-related research and analysis.

### Workflows

PepLab supports multiple workflows for processing peptide libraries. The existing `README.md` provides an overview of the workflows using a Mermaid diagram.

#### Current Workflows

1. **Input Processing**:
    - Handles library definition JSON and converts SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) to graphs.
    - Direct SMILES Path:
        - Converts SMILES to graphs and creates peptides directly.
        - Generates 3D structures through conformer generation, MD simulation, or experimental structure loading.
    - Residue-Based Path:
        - Parses residue library and converts SMILES to graphs.
        - Identifies reactive sites and creates residues.

2. **Reactivity Analysis**:
    - Calculates reactivity scores for each reactive site.
    - Applies temperature effects and generates possible pathways.
    - Scores pathway viability and provides ranked pathways.

3. **Reaction Planning**:
    - Evaluates reaction conditions and selects preferred pathways.
    - Checks site compatibility and evaluates reaction conditions.

4. **Reaction Execution**:
    - Initializes selected reactions and checks spatial arrangements.
    - Begins bond formation, updates electron positions, and generates new molecules.

5. **Library Assembly and Analysis**:
    - Adds peptides to the library and calculates properties.
